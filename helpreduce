My sweet ambition but it's not all implemented rn

reduce N some.table [flags]

-notAON
    Allows all types of gates, not just And, Or, Not gates
-DNF
-m, -monotonic
-gates [comma separated truth tables]
-d, depth [maxDepth]
    Default depth is unbounded.
-f, -fanin [fanin] 
    Default fan-in is 2. btw I actually think implementing this might be more insane than i realised
-bf
    Attempt to bruteforce solve the resultant SAT problem rather than outputting it in DIMACS format.
